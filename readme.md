# A GitHub Mirror of Beall's List
Beall's list was a list of predatory journals and publishers, originally published by Jeffrey Beall. Preadatory journals are journals which allow papers to be published for a fee, thereby acting as credential mills for those who need "scientist"/"researcher" qualifications. 

I've mirrored it here as of Jan 24th, 2017, Beall last updated it December 31st, 2016. 

PR's welcome!
